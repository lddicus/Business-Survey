# Business-Survey
This is a visualization of the data collected by a survey made in collaboration between Facebook, OECD, and the World Bank. The survey asks Small and Medium Enterprises (SME's) on challenges and insights they have in their companies, and this visualization hopes to show these insights for other businesses.
